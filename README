Timezone Converter
==================

Display time converted from one timezone to another timezone.

Timezone in format of /usr/share/zoneinfo directory structure:
      e.g. Australia/Sydney, Europe/Rome, Zulu, Israel

Input either:
      timezone				local machine's localtime is converted to that timezone; or
      timezone time timezone		the time in the first timezone is converted to the second timezone.
Output:
      a formatted string of the time; or
      a list of possible candidate timezones if the supplied one(s) is not recognised.
Usage:
      tz Europe/Rome
      tz "Europe/Paris" "2004-10-30 06:30" "America/New_York"
      tz Australia/Sydney "2011-05-06 19:28" America/New_York

Examples:
      Normal:
          $ tz Europe/Rome
                Thu, 12 May 2011 06:57:09 +0200 (CEST)
          $ tz Australia/Sydney "2011-05-06 19:28" America/New_York
                Fri, 06 May 2011 05:28:00 -0400 (EDT)
      Not found:
          $ tz paris
            "paris" timezone not found.  Possible candidates:
            Europe/Paris
      Using a regex:
          $ tz "s(ain)?t_"
                "s(ain)?t_" timezone not found.  Possible candidates:
                America/St_Barthelemy
                America/St_Johns
                America/St_Kitts
                America/St_Lucia
                America/St_Thomas
                America/St_Vincent
                Atlantic/St_Helena

Compilation:
       cc tz.c -Wall -O2  -o tz

       The timezone.h file is almost certainly correct for a unix-like system, including Linux.  If you have to generate the entries
       in timzone.h for your machine, run `find /usr/share/zoneinfo -type f -ls | cut -d '/'  -f 5-9` and edit the output in your
       editor to add leading " and trailing ", .   The posix and right directory entries can be deleted, along with zone.tab.
       You will need to regenerate (or manually add) the entries if a new timezone is created in the world.  I imagine this would
       be a very rare event.
