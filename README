Timezone Converter
==================

Display time converted from one timezone to another timezone.

Input either:
    timezone			Local machine's localtime is converted to that timezone; or
    timezone time timezone	The time in the first timezone is converted to the second timezoner; or
    regex			Timezones are searched using the regex (which can be a simple string).	

Input Formats:
    timezone is in the format of the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory structure:
	e.g. Australia/Sydney, Europe/Rome, Zulu, Israel
    time in either of two strftime formats (which can be changed in #define in the source code):
	"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" or %Y%m%d%H%M (the second for quick and dirty typing without legibility).

Output:
    a formatted string of the time; or
    a list of possible candidate timezones.

Usage:
    tz Europe/Rome
    tz "Europe/Paris" "2004-10-30 06:30" "America/New_York"
    tz Australia/Sydney "2011-05-06 19:28" America/New_York

Examples:
    Normal:
	$ tz Europe/Rome
	    Thu, 12 May 2011 06:57:09 +0200 (CEST)
	$ tz Australia/Sydney "2011-05-06 19:28" America/New_York
	    Fri, 06 May 2011 05:28:00 -0400 (EDT)
    Not found:
	$ tz paris
	"paris" timezone not found.  Possible candidates:
	Europe/Paris
    Using a regex:
	$ tz "s(ain)?t_"
	    "s(ain)?t_" timezone not found.  Possible candidates:
	    America/St_Barthelemy
	    America/St_Johns
	    America/St_Kitts
	    America/St_Lucia
	    America/St_Thomas
	    America/St_Vincent
	    Atlantic/St_Helena

Compilation:
    cc tz.c -Wall -O2  -o tz

    The timezone.h file is almost certainly correct for a unix-like
    system, including Linux.  If you have to generate the entries in
    timzone.h for your machine, run `find /usr/share/zoneinfo -type f -ls
    | cut -d '/'  -f 5-9` and edit the output or use sed to add leading "
    char and trailing ", chars.   The posix and right directory entries
    can be deleted, along with zone.tab.  You will need to regenerate (or
    manually add) the entries if a new timezone is created in the world
    and your /usr/share/timezone entries change.  I imagine this would be
    a very rare event.
